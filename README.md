This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in TypeScript related to type coercion. The `add` function is declared to accept two numbers, but the code attempts to add a string and a number.  TypeScript's type system does not prevent this, leading to unexpected string concatenation at runtime instead of numeric addition.  The solution demonstrates how to improve type safety and prevent this issue.
